### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my Github!.. 🎉

I'm a student at DTU, studying Software Technology📚. Which has given me profeciency in:
- C, C#, C++
- Java
- Python
- Software Development principles like SOLID.

I also indulge in crazy projects on my own, like starting a webdevelopment company called Webased💻. This has given me proficiency in languages like,
- C#
- Javascript / Typescript
  - React
- HTML
- CSS

I'm an extensive learner and love to learn about anything and everything! I am always ready to indulge in new projects to widen my horizon.

I'm academically fluent in English and Danish.

Best Regards,

Lucas J. Sjøstrøm.
